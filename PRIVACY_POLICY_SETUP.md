# How to Set Up Privacy Policy URL on GitHub Pages

APKPure requires a Privacy Policy URL. Here's how to set it up for free using GitHub Pages:

## Option 1: Quick Setup (Recommended)

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to: https://github.com/Youseftemu1/huroofi/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select: **Deploy from a branch**
3. Branch: **main**
4. Folder: **/ (root)**
5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Rename the file
The privacy policy file is already created as `privacy-policy.html`. GitHub Pages will automatically serve it.

### Step 3: Access your Privacy Policy
Your privacy policy will be available at:
```
https://youseftemu1.github.io/huroofi/privacy-policy.html
```

### Step 4: Use this URL in APKPure
When APKPure asks for Privacy Policy URL, enter:
```
https://youseftemu1.github.io/huroofi/privacy-policy.html
```

## Option 2: Custom Domain (Optional)
If you have a custom domain, you can use it instead.

## Verification
1. Wait 1-2 minutes after enabling GitHub Pages
2. Visit: https://youseftemu1.github.io/huroofi/privacy-policy.html
3. You should see your privacy policy page

## Notes
- GitHub Pages is free
- The URL will be permanent
- You can update the privacy policy by editing the HTML file and pushing to GitHub
- Changes may take a few minutes to appear
